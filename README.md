### Running the Application

To start the development server:

Using npm:
```bash                                                                                                                                                    
npm run dev                                                                                                                                                
```                                                                                                                                                        
Or using yarn:
```bash                                                                                                                                                    
yarn dev                                                                                                                                                   
```                                                                                                                                                        

This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

-   `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser. The page
    will reload if you make edits.
